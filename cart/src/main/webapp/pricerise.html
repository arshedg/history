            This is my first letter to you. Let me begin with a thank you for trusting us and using our product. We assure you that we will keep up with the trust and provide you the best service and quality at the most affordable price.
          
            Recently, we are getting lot of complaints that we are constantly increasing our prices. We do acknwoledge that the prices have gone north in the past one week. 10 days ago we were selling Sardine at 80Rs a Kg, whereas the price has touched RS 140 now. The King fish which was selling at 500 per Kg is now at 700 a Kg.
            <br/><br/>
            This is because of the shortage of fishes in the Kerala costals. Most of the fishes that are currently available in the market  are coming from other states. As per the expert opinions, the shortage of fish will not last for more than 2 weeks and the prices will come down subsequently.
            <br/><br/>
            Currently the prices of the fishes has gone up all over the Kerala because of this shortage. We are in constant negotiation with the wholesellers to get fishes at a better price.
            <br/><br/>
            If you compare the prices of our fishes with any other fish stalls, you will be pleasently surprised to know that we are selling at lower rates with better quality. 
            Please do note that for fishes/sea-food like mussels, king fish etc we weigh only the meat. For example in case of mussels we weigh the product after removing the shell. Similary in case of king fish you pay the price only for the meat, not for the stomach, gills etc.
